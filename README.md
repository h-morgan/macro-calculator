# macro-calculator
Program to calculate a person's macronutrients based on their fitness goals.

## What does this program do?
- User enters some info to a form:
  - Age, weight, and, height (US units)
  - Activity level 
  - Body type
- Program calculates the user's base metabolic rate (BMR) - this is the number of calories required to keep the body functioning at rest
- Program then calculates the user's total caloric expenditure (TCE) - this is the amount of calories burnt per day 
- Using BMR and TCE, the program then calculates approximate calorie intake the user would be required to maintain to stay at the weight they are at
- Once calorie intake is calculated, the program then considers the user's body type and calculates the macronutrient breakdown required for that person to achieve the entered weight (or maintain their weight)
